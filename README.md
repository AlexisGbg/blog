# blog
This is the source code of my blog. You can check it at [alexis-guibourge.blog](https://alexis-guibourge.blog). If you like it, help yourself :) 

## Usage
The blog is written in python and based the framework *Django*. To get yourself started, initialize a django app and replace some files with the files in there. You'll also need to connect *Django* to a database of your choice (see [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/databases/)). And this should be it. Have fun!
