# A SSP to Control the Ad Quality you Display on your Website

In modern advertising, humans are replaced by machines to make deals between publishers and advertisers. Although this is a wonderful solution to scale up to the size of the Internet, this also brings some problems with it. Indeed, Internet is quite a dangerous place for naive machines ready to display any ad for money: it might ends up into you advertising doubtful websites asking for urgent donations to be transferred in bitcoins. Here, the naive machine to be blamed is the so-called Supply-Side Platform (SSP)... Basically, as soon as a web user appears on your website, your SSP broadcasts a message asking if anyone is interested in displaying ads for this user. Hopefully, several advertisers will respond back with an offer ($$). As a SSP basically is in a **public auction** mode, any advertiser can participate and the best offer will be taken by the SSP. Now, a lot of bad quality ads are provided by advertisers having low budget and not willing to pay much for the suspicious content they spread. Therefore, the hack is to define a minimum under which advertisers are not allowed to participate: the SSP then enters the **private auction** mode. If no offer is above this minimum, no ads will be displayed (and itâ€™s better so).
