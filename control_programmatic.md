# Get control back over programmatic advertising

Allowing anyone in the wild internet community to display ads on your website might rightly frighten you: you surely donâ€™t wanna break your image by being associated with some lousy businesses using your person to advertise junk products. If you want to get full control over the programmatic world, you must tie the machines making deals with the advertisers for you.  A way to do so are private deals. They remove all the flexibility these machines have by fixing in advance a. who can display ads on your website and b. at which price. Advantage: a fully transparent deal. Drawback: you go back to a cumbersome, time consuming and manual mode where advertisers must be found and deals negotiated. Now, you might wonder what the difference with the somehow outdated Insertion Order (IO) advertising is? Conceptually, no difference. Technically, instead of using your homebrew ad tech solution, you use the programmatic ecosystem with slave machines having no choice but to make the exact deal you wanted. And here is the trick: as soon as you are bored with the additional effort private deals generate, unleash the machines with a click and dive in the programmatic world again.
