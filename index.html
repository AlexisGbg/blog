<h2>A programming paradigm?</h2>
<p>
There is a misconception about programming paradigms: one often associates them to specific programming languages. However, a paradigm has a lot more to do with the way you write your code as with the language you use. Let us consider two fundamental and antagonist programming paradigms: imperative and declarative. In the imperative approach, you would write your code as you would write a recipe: do this, then that and finally this. In the declarative approach, you’re focusing on describing the result: cake should be like this, have that, and contain this. Now, it doesn’t play any role if you’re using English or German to do so: as soon as the language you use is sophisticated enough to manipulate the needed concepts, you can do both. Of course, some primitive language like HTML or assembly language aren’t sophisticated enough to let you adopt any paradigm, and you can surely say that HTML is a declarative language (it describes how a web page should look like, but leave it to the browser to build it) and that assembly language is an imperative language (that describes step after step what the micro-chip should do). However, are R or Python declarative or imperative languages? This depends on your code!

<h2>Get control back over programmatic advertising</h2>
<p>
Allowing anyone in the wild internet community to display ads on your website might rightly frighten you: you surely don’t wanna break your image by being associated with some lousy businesses using your person to advertise junk products. If you want to get full control over the programmatic world, you must tie the machines making deals with the advertisers for you. A way to do so are private deals. They remove all the flexibility these machines have by fixing in advance a. who can display ads on your website and b. at which price. Advantage: a fully transparent deal. Drawback: you go back to a cumbersome, time consuming and manual mode where advertisers must be found and deals negotiated. Now, you might wonder what the difference with the somehow outdated Insertion Order (IO) advertising is? Conceptually, no difference. Technically, instead of using your homebrew ad tech solution, you use the programmatic ecosystem with slave machines having no choice but to make the exact deal you wanted. And here is the trick: as soon as you are bored with the additional effort private deals generate, unleash the machines with a click and dive in the programmatic world again.

<h2>Suspicious ads on your website</h2>
<p>
In modern advertising, humans are replaced by machines to make deals between publishers and advertisers. Although this is a wonderful solution to scale up to the size of the Internet, this also brings some problems with it. Indeed, Internet is quite a dangerous place for naive machines ready to display any ad for money: it might ends up into you advertising doubtful websites asking for urgent donations to be transferred in bitcoins. Here, the naive machine to be blamed is the so-called Supply-Side Platform (SSP)... Basically, as soon as a web user appears on your website, your SSP broadcasts a message asking if anyone is interested in displaying ads for this user. Hopefully, several advertisers will respond back with an offer ($$). As a SSP is per default in a public auction mode, any advertiser can participate and the best offer will be taken by the SSP. Now, a lot of bad ads are provided by advertisers having low budgets and not willing to pay much for the suspicious content they spread. Therefore, the hack is to define a minimum under which advertisers are not allowed to participate: the SSP then enters the private auction mode. If no offer is above this minimum, no ad will be displayed (and it’s better so).

<h2>Programmatic advertising in 5 words</h2>
<p>
Programmatic is the standard way to display ads on the Internet. Often wrongly taken to be complicated, the process is actually straightforward and involves at its core only four players. As in any advertisement deal, we have 1. the advertiser that has to show a product and 2. the publisher willing to show products for money. However, in the Internet, two new key players have dragged themselves in-between: 3. the Demand-Side Platform (DSP) and 4. the Supply-Side Platform (SSP). These are robots enabling deals to be made automatically: the humans (publisher and advertiser) specify to them under which conditions they would like to cooperate (price, webpage type and so on) and each time a web user is found, the DSP and SSP communicate to check the conditions and the ad is eventually displayed (or not). This system directly brings in two advantages over old-school advertising: on the one side an advertiser has a tremendous amount of flexibility: he can change the budget and the desired ad locations at any time. On the other side, the publisher can extract the most value of its website through a 5. generalized second-price auction mechanism, that automatically compares all the potential deals and chooses the one offering the most.
