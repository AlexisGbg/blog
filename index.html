	<h2>Update your beliefs with Bayes</h2>
	<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		All sorts of things are unreachable for us as human beings and we have no choice but to believe (or not). Take generosity, justice or God. You can never be sure someone is generous, nor can you be sure the society we live in is fair, nor can you be sure God exists. And we will never be. This can be hard to accept but we are not left alone with our beliefs though: we can observe the world. 
		</p>
		<p>
		There are things you believe in and things you see. Because you have an understanding of the world, you keep trying to check if that’s all consistent: you believe John is generous, and think about how likely it was that he gave you his cake? Probably very likely. This is called the <b>likelihood</b> and sometimes it clashes with your beliefs: you believe God exists, but your likelihood tells you that given his existence, it is very unlikely that you could see what you saw. Then you might need to update your beliefs. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Fortunately, mathematical theory solved it all for you. The keystone you need is the <b>Bayes’ theorem</b>. It is astonishingly simple: merly a multiplication and here you merged your <b>prior beliefs</b> with your likelihood to get your <b>posterior beliefs</b> (or to be exact something proportional to it). Beliefs updated.
		</p>
		<p>
		And now, relieved your posterior matches your prio?

	<h2>Vectors for the price of numbers</h2>
	<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		In the early ages of computing, a computer had one single brain, this brain could perform a single operation at the time and this was damn slow. Evolution came by and these brains transformed themselves in <b>CPU</b> beasts.
		</p>
		<p>
		A Central Processing Unit (CPU) is all about numbers: it only understands numbers, will always answer with numbers and desperately needs to process numbers. If you insanely zoom in this computer brain, you’ll find where all the magic happens: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (<b>ALU</b>). This tiny machine has two baskets, called registers in the jargon, that each needs to be filled with a single number. As soon as it’s done, the ALU eats them, digests them, and throws you another number back. All fine, but how to get it faster?
		</p>
		<p>
		In the quest for speed, CPUs have evolved and ALUs with them. In particular, the size of the baskets mentioned above got bigger, much bigger, so much bigger that it became a pity to only put a single number in them. So we filled the basket’s empty space with other numbers, building vectors, and made the ALUs digest these vectors for the price of numbers. 
		</p>
		<p>
		And here is a step towards parallelization called <b>vectorization</b>!

	<h2>Computational cost center</h2>
	<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		Matrices are incredibly convenient to represent the world around us. They can be thought as maps, matching the real world to numbers, and you will definitely need them to simulate anything. But this comes at a cost: matrices are greedy, they want a lot of your computational power and this will slow you down...
		</p>
		<p>
		If you have two numbers, you only need one logical operation to multiply them. If you have two vectors, each containing let say 10 numbers, you need 10 operations to multiply them. And there it comes: if you have two matrices, each having 10 rows and 10 columns, you almost need 2000 operations to multiply them. Now 2000 operations isn’t what a computer can’t handle, but double the number of rows and columns and you need eight times more operations (and therefore time) to perform the same computation: that’s the so called <b>cubic growth</b>. There are mathematical shortcuts to lower this huge growth but no matter what you do, this growth will always stay high. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Aside from these tricks there isn’t much one can do about this problem but to helplessly hope the matrix won’t be too big and wait. The braver can try to <b>parallelize</b>, that is to collect computers and distribute the operations over them so that these can be done simultaneously. But here is the bitter truth: no matter how much computers one founds, should the matrix edges double in size and one would need 8 times as much computers for equal performance. 
		</p>
		<p>
		One cannot compete with cubic growth.

	<h2>Explore probabilities with Markov chains</h2>
	<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		Imagine you’re travelling in another galaxy containing a form of life. You’re commissioned to find it but there is a problem: you cannot see anything because of a thick dark matter fog. The only tool for your purpose is a sensor indicating the probability that life is where you are. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Well, then finding life will be difficult. But you can at least try to find the region having a high probability of containing life. To do so, you could take a little step in a direction randomly chosen, look a the probability, repeat and hope the probability will increase. This <b>random walk</b> is called Brownian motion and the diffusion equation tells us that you will be drained in the depths of the galaxy. Bad idea. The second option would also be to take a step in a random direction, but to go back if the probability of life decreases. If you do so your travel will eventually land on the point in the universe having the highest life probability. Yeah! 
		</p>
		<p>
		But wait: this probability might still be ridiculously small, and if you stay on this single point, you would do a far worse job than the one exploring a huge region of smaller but still significant probabilities. However, to explore this same huge region, the trick is surprisingly simple: just allow yourself to sometimes go in direction lowering the probability of life. Conrgatulation, You now travel in a <b>Markov chain Monte Carlo</b> (MCMC) fashion.

	<h2>Be careful, you’re tracked</h2>
	<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		It begins like this: you’re visiting <i>www.abc.com</i> for the first time and you just clicked on the pop-up asking for permission to blah blah blah. At this moment, the site owner receives a fire at will acknowledgement and bombs your browser with tons of cookies. You’re tagged.
		</p>
		<p>
		A cookie is a sticker containing a single piece of information about one of your actions on the website, and it will stay with you for a while (~30 days). The next time you go on this website, the website owner will be able to see these stickers, drop new ones, and build a profile of your person: what you've clicked, what you've liked, what you've visited. However, there is a bit of security in there: a website is only allowed to read its own cookies and it has by no way access to your Amazon / Google / Facebook cookies and can’t see what you did there. Whew. 
		</p>
		<p>
		But oooh! there is a workaround... The cookie machine gun from <i>www.abc.com</i> can be placed on other websites. If another website accepts to do this, <i>www.abc.com</i> would be able to watch what’s happening there. Fortunately, there is no way that any Google would accept to do such a thing. However, the reverse is not true. Almost every website displaying ads on the internet has the Google cookie machine gun. The deal is simple: enable Google to watch what is going on on your website, and Google brings you ads and money. And here you’re tracked.

	<h2>Boost your machines</h2>
	<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		Let us assume you have a machine and you trained it to guess the weather (sunny or rainy) of a given day (with help of some indicators like humidity or temperature). Unfortunately, your machine is a bit flawed and it performs only poorly (slightly better than random guessing though). Then, unsatisfied as you are, you must trash the machine and find another one. But wait! there is another option: boost it.  
		</p>
		<p>
		If you’ve got such a machine, then it’s probably a piece of software. And what’s great about such pieces is that you can copy them indefinitely (as long as gigs are left on your hard drive). So here you go with boosting: build yourself an army of flawed machines by cloning the initial one hundred or thousand times. Then train a first machine: reward it when it makes correct guesses, punish it otherwise. Go on to a second machine but twist the rewarding process:  punish this machine harder when it makes the same mistakes as the previous one. Hopefully, if you continue the process, the pain of making the same mistakes as all others becomes so high that the newly trained machines are forced to learn something new and get it right. Continue this process until you reached the last machine.
		</p>
		<p>
		You now have a trained army of second-rate machines. Each machine is able to guess (poorly) the weather of a given day, yet all the machines won’t agree with one another (per design)… But here comes the boosting magic: make your army vote, give more weight to the machines that showed better performances during the training, and here you are with a first-rate weather prediction engine.

	<h2>Are you managing yourself?</h2>
	<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		Then you should probably know <b>1.</b> what you’re good at <b>2.</b> how you work the best and <b>3.</b> what your values are.  
		</p>
		<p>
		Now, this is usually extremely hard to find out. We never had indeed to bother about this in 2 million years of mankind history:  hunter-gatherers were born, peasants were born, kings were born. Moreover, the "what" and the "how" are tightly related: what you think you’re good at depends on how you think you work the best. Have one wrong and you’re all wrong (and this happens more than we think)
		</p>
		<p>
		These three personality-characteristics mentioned above are given to you and you can’t do much but find them. Yet, here is how you could get started: <i>a.</i> use feedback analysis to find your strength (try and learn) <i>b.</i> cast yourself in one of the listener, reader, speaker or writer categories to find out how you work the best and <i>c.</i> think about who you want to see in the mirror to discover your values (mirror test).
		</p>
		<p>
		Then you’re in position to define <b>4.</b> the contribution you want to do and and <b>5.</b> what result do you expect from yourself. These 5 points solved and you’ve managed yourself from competent to outstanding performer. (<i>Inspired from Peter F. Drucker - Managing Oneself</i>).

	<h2>A programming paradigm?</h2>
	<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		There is a misconception about programming paradigms: one often associates them to specific languages. However, a paradigm has a lot more to do with the way you write your code as with the language you use. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Let us consider two fundamental and antagonist programming paradigms: <b>imperative</b> and <b>declarative</b>. In the imperative approach, you would write your code as you would write a recipe: do this, then that and finally this. In the declarative approach, you’re focusing on describing the result: cake should be like this, have that, and contain this. Now, it doesn’t play any role if you’re using English or German to do so: as soon as the language you use is sophisticated enough to manipulate the needed concepts, you can do both. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, some primitive languages like HTML or assembly aren’t sophisticated enough to let you adopt any paradigm, and you can surely say that HTML is a declarative language (it describes how a web page should look like, but leave it to the browser to build it) and that assembly is an imperative language (that describes step after step what the micro-chip should do). However, are R or Python declarative or imperative? Depends on your code!

	<h2>Get control back over programmatic advertising</h2>
	<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		Allowing anyone in the wild internet community to display ads on your website might rightly frighten you: you surely don’t wanna break your image by being associated with some lousy businesses using your person to advertise junk products.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you want to get full control over the programmatic world, you must tie the machines making deals with the advertisers for you. A way to do so are <b>private deals</b> (also called programmatic guarenteed). They remove all the flexibility these machines have by fixing in advance <i>a.</i> who can display ads on your website and <i>b.</i> at which price. Advantage: a fully transparent deal. Drawback: you go back to a cumbersome, time consuming and manual mode where advertisers must be found and deals negotiated.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now, you might wonder what the difference is with the somehow outdated <b>Insertion Order</b> (IO) advertising? Conceptually, no difference. Technically, instead of using your homebrew ad tech solution, you use the programmatic ecosystem with slave machines having no choice but to make the exact deal you wanted. And here is the cherry: as soon as you are bored with the additional effort private deals generate, unleash the machines with a click and dive in the programmatic world back.

	<h2>Suspicious ads on your website</h2>
		<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		In modern advertising, humans are replaced by machines to make deals between publishers and advertisers. Although this is a wonderful solution to scale up to the size of the Internet, this also brings some problems with it. Indeed, Internet is quite a dangerous place for naive machines ready to display any ad for money: it might ends up into you advertising doubtful websites asking for urgent donations to be transferred in bitcoins.
		</p>
		<p>
		Here, the naive machine to be blamed is the so-called <b>Supply-Side Platform</b> (SSP)... Basically, as soon as a web user appears on your website, your SSP broadcasts a message asking if anyone is interested in displaying ads for this user. Hopefully, several advertisers will respond back with an offer ($$). As a SSP is per default in a public auction mode, any advertiser can participate and the best offer will be taken by the SSP. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Now, a lot of bad ads are provided by advertisers having low budgets and not willing to pay much for the suspicious content they spread. Therefore, the hack is to define a minimum under which advertisers are not allowed to participate: the SSP then enters the <b>private auction mode</b>. If no offer is above this minimum, no ad will be displayed (and it’s better so).

	<h2>Programmatic advertising in 5 words</h2>
	<div class="has-content-area">
		<p>
		Programmatic is the standard way to display ads on the Internet. Often wrongly taken to be complicated, the process is actually straightforward and involves at its core only four players. 
		</p>
		<p>
		As in any advertisement deal, we have <i>1.</i> <b>the advertiser</b> that has to show a product and <i>2.</i> <b>the publisher</b> willing to show products for money. However, in the Internet, two new key players have dragged themselves in-between: <i>3.</i> <b>the Demand-Side Platform</b> (DSP) and <i>4.</i> <b>the Supply-Side Platform</b> (SSP). These are robots enabling deals to be made automatically: the humans (publisher and advertiser) specify to them under which conditions they would like to cooperate (price, ad location and so on) and each time a web user is found, the DSP and SSP communicate to check these conditions and an ad is eventually displayed (or not). 
		</p>
		<p>
		This system directly brings in two advantages over old-school advertising: on the one side an advertiser has a tremendous amount of flexibility: he can change the budget and the desired ad locations at any time. On the other side, the publisher can extract the most value of its website through a <i>5.</i> <b>generalized second-price auction</b> mechanism, that automatically compares all the potential deals and chooses the one offering the most.
