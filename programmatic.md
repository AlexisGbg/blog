# Programmatic advertising in 5 words

Programmatic is the standard way to display ads on the Internet. Often wrongly taken to be complicated, the process is actually straightforward and involves at its core only four players. As in any advertisement deal, we have **1. the advertiser** that has to show a product and **2. the publisher** willing to show products for money. However, in the Internet, two new key players have dragged themselves in-between: **3. the Demand-Side Platform** (DSP) and **4. the Supply-Side Platform** (SSP). These are robots enabling deals to be made automatically: the humans (publisher and advertiser) specify to them under which conditions they would like to cooperate (price, webpage type and so on) and each time a web user is found, the DSP and SSP communicate to check the conditions and the ad is eventually displayed (or not). This system directly brings in two advantages over old-school advertising: on the one side an advertiser has a tremendous amount of flexibility: he can change the budget and the desired ad locations at any time. On the other side, the publisher can extract the most value of its website through a **5. generalized second-price auction** mechanism, that automatically compares all the potential deals and chooses the one offering the most.
