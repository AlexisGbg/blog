# A programming paradigm?

There is a misconception about programming paradigms: one often associate them to specific programming languages. However, a paradigm has more to do with the way you write your code as with the language you use. Let us consider two fundamental and antagonist programming paradigms: imperative and declarative. In the imperative approach, you would write your code as you would write a recipe:  do this, then that and finally this. In the declarative approach, you’re focusing on describing the result: cake should be like this, have that, and contain this. Now, it doesn’t play any role if you’re using English or German to do so: as soon as the language you use is sophisticated enough to manipulate the needed concepts, you can do both. Of course, some primitive language like HTML or assembly language aren’t sophisticated enough to let you adopt any paradigm, and you can surely say that HTML is a declarative language (it describes how a web page should look like, but leave it to the browser to build it) and that assembly language is an imperative language (that describes step after step what the micro-chip should do). However, are R or python declarative or imperative languages? Depends on your code!
